Conscious Brands: The Google Extension for Ethical Shopping | GNEC Hackathon - Compete for UN
Discover Conscious Brands, a Google Extension developed for the GNEC Hackathon, where we competed for the UN. This innovative tool analyzes a store's history regarding safe working conditions, fair wages, discrimination, child or forced labor, and unionization, supporting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8.
In this video, we'll introduce you to the Conscious Brands Google Extension, explain how it works, and share our development process. If you're passionate about ethical shopping and supporting sustainable economic growth, this video is for you!
We built Conscious Brands using Figma for designing the user interface and user experience, Visual Studio Code for coding the extension with HTML and CSS, and research on existing browser extensions for ethical and sustainable shopping. We faced challenges integrating multiple technologies and frameworks, identifying and resolving bugs, and keeping up with the latest updates and best practices.
Despite these challenges, we're proud of our accomplishments, including developing a feature-rich application, fixing performance issues, creating a user-friendly interface, and defining the project scope effectively.
Looking ahead, we have exciting plans for Conscious Brands, such as expanding the database of stores and brands analyzed, incorporating user feedback and ratings, integrating with popular e-commerce platforms, and collaborating with organizations working on SDG 8.
